# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies supervised machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical and personal health data. It compares several classification models and evaluates their performance using ROC AUC, cross-validation.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)
- **Features**: 13 medical attributes (e.g., cholesterol, resting ECG, max heart rate)
- **Target**: Binary â€” `1` indicates presence of heart disease, `0` indicates no disease
